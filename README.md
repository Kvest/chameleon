Chameleon is a simple logic game. Your goal is to color the whole field in one color. And You have only 21 moves for it. Recoloring is performed by clicking round buttons. When the new color is selected - the top left cell and all adjacent cells with the same colors are recolored to the selected color.

Have fun!
